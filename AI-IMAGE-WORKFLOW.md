white background, studio lighting, commercial photography, 8k, photorealistic 
--ar 1:1 --style raw --v 6
```

---

### Method 3: Use Existing Assets (Fastest if Available)

**Steps:**
1. **Download current logo** from Shopify:
   - URL: https://pearlbeautyent.com/cdn/shop/files/Pearl-Beauty-Logo.webp
   - Save as: `/home/user/webapp/public/static/images/logo.webp`

2. **Check if client has product photos**:
   - Ask client directly for high-res images
   - Check their Shopify product listings for existing assets

3. **Grab from Shopify catalog**:
   ```bash
   # Download images from Shopify CDN (if they exist)
   curl -o /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/products/curl-gel-main.webp \
     https://pearlbeautyent.com/cdn/shop/files/curl-gel.webp
   ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Post-Generation: Image Optimization

### Convert to WebP Format (if needed)
```bash
# Install cwebp if not available
# (usually pre-installed in most systems)

# Convert PNG/JPG to WebP
cwebp -q 85 input-image.png -o curl-gel-main.webp
cwebp -q 85 input-image.jpg -o leave-in-main.webp

# Batch convert all images
for img in *.png; do
  cwebp -q 85 "$img" -o "${img%.png}.webp"
done
```

### Resize Images to Optimal Dimensions
```bash
# Using ImageMagick (if available)
convert input.jpg -resize 800x800 -quality 85 output.webp

# Or using ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i input.png -vf scale=800:800 -quality 85 output.webp
```

### Optimize File Size
```bash
# Check current file sizes
ls -lh /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/products/

# Target: Keep each image under 150KB for fast loading
# If images are too large, reduce quality:
cwebp -q 75 input.webp -o output-optimized.webp
```

## üìÅ File Organization

### Directory Structure
```
/home/user/webapp/public/static/images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.webp                          # Pearl Beauty logo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ products/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ curl-gel-main.webp            # Curl Defining Gel
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ leave-in-main.webp            # Leave-In Conditioner
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shampoo-main.webp             # Shampoo
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ edge-control-main.webp        # Edge Control
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hero/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ caribbean-background.webp      # (Optional) Hero section background
```

### Add Images to Project
```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/products/
mkdir -p /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/hero/

# Move generated images to correct locations
# (After downloading from AI tool)
mv ~/Downloads/curl-gel-main.webp /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/products/

## ‚ö° Quick Commands Cheatsheet

```bash
# CREATE DIRECTORIES
mkdir -p /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/{products,hero}/

# DOWNLOAD EXISTING LOGO
curl -o /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/logo.webp \
  https://pearlbeautyent.com/cdn/shop/files/Pearl-Beauty-Logo.webp

# VERIFY IMAGES
ls -lhR /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/

# CHECK FILE SIZES
du -sh /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/*

# COMMIT IMAGES
cd /home/user/webapp && git add public/static/images/ && git commit -m "‚ú® Add product images"

# BUILD AND TEST LOCALLY
cd /home/user/webapp && npm run build && npm run dev:sandbox
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading in Browser
```bash
# Check file paths match exactly
ls /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/products/

# Expected files:
# - curl-gel-main.webp
# - leave-in-main.webp
# - shampoo-main.webp
# - edge-control-main.webp

# Check serveStatic config in src/index.tsx
# Line should be: app.use('/static/*', serveStatic({ root: './public' }))
```

### Images Too Large (Slow Loading)
```bash
# Check file sizes
ls -lh /home/user/webapp/public/static/images/products/

# If over 200KB each, re-optimize:
cwebp -q 75 curl-gel-main.webp -o curl-gel-main-optimized.webp
mv curl-gel-main-optimized.webp curl-gel-main.webp
```

### Wrong Image Format
```bash
# Convert to WebP if you have PNG/JPG
cwebp -q 85 image.png -o image.webp
```

## üé® Next Level: Hero Background (Optional)

**If you want a custom hero background image:**

### Prompt for Hero Section
```
Wide cinematic photograph of Caribbean beach scene with turquoise ocean waves and 
golden sand, soft focus, dreamy atmosphere, teal and coral color grading, professional 
travel photography, 8K resolution, shallow depth of field, warm tropical lighting 
--ar 16:9
```

**Or use gradient background (easier):**
- Already implemented in `style.css` with animated teal wave pattern
- No image needed (keeps site faster)
