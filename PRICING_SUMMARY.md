Hi Pearl,

Thanks for taking the time to review the website preview! I wanted to share a transparent breakdown of the project scope and investment.

INVESTMENT

Total Project Cost: $1,800 USD

Payment Structure:
- $900 upfront (covers all completed work)

What's Included:
- All development work (47 total hours)
- 1 month post-launch support (bug fixes, content updates)
- Unlimited revisions during development phase
- Email/WhatsApp support

Market Comparison:
- Typical agency rate: $3,500-5,000 for similar projects
- Your investment: $1,800 (40-50% savings)
- Why the discount? You're my first beauty brand client, and I want to build a strong portfolio piece and long-term partnership

NEXT STEPS

If this works for your budget, here's how we proceed:

1. You provide the remaining assets (product photos, before/after images, videos)
2. Payment 1: $900 USD via [Wise/PayPal/Bank Transfer]
3. I complete the final development sprint (1-2 weeks)
4. We launch the live site
5. Payment 2: $900 USD on launch day
6. 1 month of support begins

OPTIONAL: Future Growth Partnership

After launch, if the site performs well, I'd love to discuss ongoing support at a monthly retainer:
- Social media content creation ($400-650/month packages)
- Performance optimization and updates
- Email marketing campaigns
- Paid advertising management

YOUR QUESTIONS

I want to make sure this feels right for you. Some questions to consider:

- Does the $1,800 investment work within your marketing budget?
- Would you prefer the two-payment plan ($900 + $900) or a three-payment plan ($600 + $600 + $600)?
- Do you have the remaining assets ready, or do you need help sourcing/creating them?
- Any features or sections you'd like adjusted before final launch?

Looking forward to officially launching Caribbean Players and helping Pearl Beauty reach more customers across the Caribbean and diaspora!

Let me know your thoughts.

## 🎯 Handling Common Objections

### "That seems expensive"
**Response:** "I totally understand budget concerns. To put it in perspective, traditional agencies charge $3,500-5,000 for similar projects. I'm offering $1,800 because you're my first beauty brand client and I want to build a strong portfolio piece. We can also do a three-payment plan ($600 x 3) if that helps with cash flow."

### "Can we do a lower rate?"
**Response:** "I've already discounted this 36% below market rate as a first-client special. The $1,800 represents ~47 hours of work at $38/hour, which is below even entry-level freelancer rates. However, I can offer the three-payment option to make it more manageable: $600 upfront, $600 at 50% completion, $600 on launch."

### "I don't have all the photos/videos yet"
**Response:** "No problem! We can launch in phases. I can complete the backend setup, analytics, and QA testing while you gather the assets. We'll do a soft launch with placeholders and swap in real content as it becomes available. The pricing stays the same regardless of timeline."

### "Can you include the monthly retainer in the launch price?"
**Response:** "The $1,800 covers the full website development and 1 month of post-launch support (bug fixes, minor updates). The monthly retainer packages ($400-650/month) are separate ongoing services that include fresh content creation, marketing campaigns, and optimization work. We can discuss those after launch once you see how the site performs."
