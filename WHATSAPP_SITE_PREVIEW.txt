Hi Pearl! 👋

Wanted to share the website progress with you - it's looking really good and I'm excited for you to see it!

🌐 **Preview Site:** https://pearlbeautyent-website.pages.dev

Take a look and let me know your thoughts! You can navigate through:
✅ Smart quiz (click "Take the Quiz")
✅ Before & After gallery (scroll down or click "View Before & After")
✅ Ingredients science section (click "Learn Why It Works")
✅ Mobile menu (works great on phones)
✅ Your logo in the header with proper branding

**What's Working:**
- Full conversion-optimized copy focused on humidity-proof results
- Climate-specific messaging (Houston, Miami, NYC, DC)
- Quiz that helps customers find the right products
- Mobile-responsive design (looks great on all devices)
- Professional branding with your logo and colors

**What Still Needs Real Content:**
- Product photos (currently using placeholders)
- Customer before/after images (currently using stock photos)
- Video testimonials (currently using placeholder videos)
- Hero background image (curly hair visual)

Once you have a chance to review it, I'd love to walk you through the project details and pricing. I've put together a transparent breakdown of everything completed so far and what's needed to launch officially.

Looking forward to your feedback!
